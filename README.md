## A simple key bind conflict resolution mod for Minecraft
### Mod Loader: Fabric for 1.20.1
<details>
<summary>Goal & Functionality</summary>
<p>Our primary goal is to provide a player with ability to see keybinds in their minecraft game that conflict with eachother due to various circumstances (most notably, mods)
We then aim to provide a friendly, intuitive, and searchable GUI to allow the player to choose the keybinding they want to use, and to favorite their results for future reference.
We also aim to provide a semi-autocomplete functionality when the player looks to search for their keybindings.</p>
